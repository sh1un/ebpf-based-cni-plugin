## Inspiration

This project is inspired by [asayah](https://github.com/asayah)'s talk on building an eBPF-based CNI plugin:
ðŸ‘‰ [YouTube: Building an eBPF CNI plugin from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cqCmtg-TOo)

I extended the original design by adapting it to work with **TC (Traffic Control)** hooks instead of XDP, and added some features.
